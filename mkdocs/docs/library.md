# Library Design

Iceberg C++ splits its code into a few libraries so applications can link only
what they need.

## Library boundaries

### `iceberg`

The core library contains schemas, table metadata, manifests, snapshots, table
updates, catalog interfaces, Puffin files, etc. It also owns the Arrow C Data
interface and the nanoarrow-based utilities used by core metadata and data
processing code. These utilities do not depend on the Arrow C++ library.

### `iceberg_data`

This library handles data-plane processing, including delete filtering, data
writers, and scan task readers. Concrete Avro and Parquet readers and writers
are supplied by the `iceberg_bundle` library.

### `iceberg_bundle`

This library combines `iceberg_data` with the Arrow C++, Avro, Parquet, and
Arrow filesystem integrations. It gives applications one link-time dependency.
It is enabled by default in both CMake and Meson. Use
`ICEBERG_BUILD_BUNDLE=OFF` or `-Dbundle=disabled` to omit it.

### `iceberg_rest`, `iceberg_hive`, `iceberg_sql_catalog`

These optional catalog libraries cover REST, Hive Metastore, and SQL databases.
Each depends on `iceberg` and its own client libraries, not on `iceberg_data` or
`iceberg_bundle`.

## Source and header ownership

Production files are kept in the directory for the library that builds them:

- Core files stay in the `iceberg` root or core subdirectories such as
  `deletes/`, `puffin/`, `manifest/`, and `update/`.
- Files under `data/` are built into `iceberg_data`.
- Files under `arrow/`, `avro/`, and `parquet/` are built into
  `iceberg_bundle`.
- Optional catalog implementations stay under `catalog/rest/`, `catalog/hive/`,
  and `catalog/sql/` and are built into their corresponding catalog libraries.

The Arrow C Data files in the `iceberg` root are core infrastructure and are
separate from the Arrow C++ integration under `arrow/`.

Public headers are installed with their existing `iceberg/...` include paths.
Headers whose names contain `internal` are not installed.

## Runtime registration

The core library defines registries for optional file readers, writers, and
filesystem implementations. Integrations register their implementations as
follows:

- Arrow local and S3 `FileIO` implementations are registered when the Arrow
  integration is loaded. `iceberg::arrow::RegisterAll()` additionally registers
  Arrow-based batch projection.
- Avro readers, writers, and logical types are registered by
  `iceberg::avro::RegisterAll()`.
- Parquet readers and writers are registered by
  `iceberg::parquet::RegisterAll()`.
