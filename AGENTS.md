# Apache Iceberg C++ — Agent Instructions

This file provides repository-specific guidance for automated agents working
in this repository.

## Security Model

When assessing potential vulnerabilities or calibrating automated security
findings, use [`SECURITY-THREAT-MODEL.md`](SECURITY-THREAT-MODEL.md) as the
authoritative detailed description of this repository's security boundaries,
trust assumptions, and non-boundaries.

## Build System Consistency

Keep CMake and Meson build definitions in sync. When adding, removing, or
renaming source files, headers, tests, or build targets, or changing dependencies
or build options, update the corresponding CMake (`CMakeLists.txt` and CMake
modules) and Meson (`meson.build` and `meson.options`) definitions in the same
change.

## PR & Commit Conventions

- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages.
- Run `pre-commit` for every PR and fix any reported issues.
