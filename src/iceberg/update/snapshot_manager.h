/// Rollback: This API does not allow conflicting calls to SetCurrentSnapshot and
/// RollbackToTime. When committing, these changes will be applied to the current table
/// metadata. Commit conflicts will not be resolved and will result in a
///
/// Cherrypick: In an audit workflow, new data is written to an orphan snapshot that is
/// not committed as the table's current state until it is audited. After auditing a
/// change, it may need to be applied or cherry-picked on top of the latest snapshot
/// instead of the one that was current when the audited changes were created. This class
/// adds support for cherry-picking the changes from an orphan snapshot by applying them
/// to the current snapshot. The output of the operation is a new snapshot with the
/// changes from cherry-picked snapshot.
